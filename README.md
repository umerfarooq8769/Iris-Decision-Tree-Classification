# 🌳 Iris Classification using Decision Tree
Building a tree-based model to classify flower species with high precision.

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I implemented a **Decision Tree Classifier**, which is a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a "test" on an attribute. This model is highly effective for the Iris dataset.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- **Algorithm:** Decision Tree Classifier (Scikit-Learn).
- **Visualization:** PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to visualize the 4D Iris data in a 2D plot.
- **Workflow:** - Data loading and cleaning with **Pandas**.
    - Feature scaling and splitting (90/10 ratio).
    - Model training and accuracy evaluation.



## 📊 Methodology & Visualization
I used **PCA** to reduce the dataset's dimensions, allowing us to see how the Decision Tree separates the different species clusters visually.



## 🎯 Key Benefits
- **Non-linear Relationships:** Unlike Linear Regression, Decision Trees can capture complex patterns.
- **Easy to Understand:** The logic of how a flower is classified is easy to trace.
